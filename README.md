# Theatre Seat Reservation System

This mini project is a console-based Theatre Seat Reservation System developed using the C++ programming language. It simulates a basic ticket booking experience, allowing users to view available seats, reserve them, cancel reservations, and track booking records—all through a structured, menu-driven interface.
Designed for clarity and ease of use, the system leverages arrays, classes, and functions to manage seat layouts, reservation status, and user interactions. It’s an ideal project for beginners learning C++, as it introduces core programming concepts like object-oriented design, loops, conditionals, and modular architecture.
Whether you're building it for academic practice or as a foundation for a more advanced booking system, this project demonstrates how to manage real-world data in a clean, interactive, and scalable way.
